# Oxide

Oxide is a middleware for web-applications, similar in fashion to applications
like [Rack][1] and [Ring][2]. It allows web-app frameworks to be written on top
of Oxide and allows web-servers to interface through Oxide, thereby creating
the _glue_ necessary to make everything work. The difference being that this
framework targets the [Rust][3] language by [Mozilla][4].

## Status
Currently this is just a project that I am still baking on and heavy dev-work
has not yet started (really at all at this point). 

## Contributing
If you're interested in contributing to the project, feel free to talk to me
at me@johnmurray.io or contribute a patch/feature (if there is any code by
then)!
